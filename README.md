## Summary

This is my triptych exercise from the week on HTML and CSS web art as part of the Gray Area Creative Code Intensive. I wanted to experiment with movement using only HTML and CSS. I started with the code from this [Pure CSS Bouncing Ball](http://cssnewbie.com/pure-css-bouncing-ball/#.X3ZYJpNKjUJ) tutorial. The original intent was to have the pressed flowers bouncing around inside one of the three boxes but I was having difficulty accomplishing that. Then I realized that as is it is a beautiful metaphor for nature's irreverence for political boundaries.
